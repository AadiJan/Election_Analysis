# Election_Analysis

## Project Overview 
Tom, a Colorado Board of Elections employee has requested to complete the election audit of a recent local congressional election. 

## Election-Audit Results: 
After performing the analysis with the 'election_results.csv', the following results were calculated for the election.
  * Data source: election_results.csv

  * The data and the output can also be found here: https://github.com/AadiJan/Election_Analysis
  * The snapshot of the election results can be found here:

## Election-Audit Summary:
The script used here for the Colarodo Board can also be used for other cities. The respective counties can be added along with the list of candidates and this script can assist the election commission to get election-audit results. In addition to the election data in election_results.csv, it would have been helpful if the total eligible voters for each county was available. The same script can be modified to perform calculations such as 'eligible voters vs actual votes casted', compare elections results of similar county/city based on the population (eligible voters).
